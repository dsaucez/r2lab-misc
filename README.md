# The R2Lab testbed

## Purpose

The R2Lab testbed, located at Inria Sophia Antipolis, and dedicated to
**reproducible** wireless experiments, is open to public usage. See
https://r2lab.inria.fr for details.

## History

The github repo parmentelat/r2lab used to contain everything needed to
run the testbed, but as it grew bigger and bigger, it has been split
into smaller more manageable pieces and moved into a github
organization of its own.

See https://github.com/fit-r2lab for the current index of repos.

## Contents

The present repo essentially contains everything that does not belong in a dedicated repo.

## Workflow

Discussions, bug tracking and feature requests are managed as github *Issues* on each individual github repo, when this is a clear choice, and here otherwise.
